# REST-API-With-Flask
In Task 4, I developed a RESTful API using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a sample dataset. The purpose of this task was to understand backend API development, implement structured JSON-based communication, and verify API functionality using Postman.
